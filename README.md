# LocalGovDrupal Service Status Block

Provides service status summary of selectable service landing pages.

## Installation
Install as with any other Drupal module and enable via Drush 
`drush en services_status_block` or at /admin/modules

If the coloured icons are not rendered, check Font Awesome settings at
/admin/config/content/fontawesome and select the 'SVG with JS' method. If you 
still encounter problems consider installing a local version of Font Awesome in 
/web/libraries rather than the default CDN external library.
